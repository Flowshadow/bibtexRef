  abstract  = {Currently, there is debate among scholars regarding how to operationalize
	and measure executive functions. These functions generally are referred
	to as "supervisory" cognitive processes because they involve higher
	level organization and execution of complex thoughts and behavior.
	Although conceptualizations vary regarding what mental processes
	actually constitute the "executive function" construct, there has
	been a historical linkage of these "higher-level" processes with
	the frontal lobes. In fact, many investigators have used the term
	"frontal functions" synonymously with "executive functions" despite
	evidence that contradicts this synonymous usage. The current review
	provides a critical analysis of lesion and neuroimaging studies using
	three popular executive function measures {(Wisconsin} Card Sorting
	Test, Phonemic Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Color Word Interference
	Test) in order to examine the validity of the executive function
	construct in terms of its relation to activation and damage to the
	frontal lobes. Empirical lesion data are examined via meta-analysis
	procedures along with formula derivatives. Results reveal mixed evidence
	that does not support a one-to-one relationship between executive
	functions and frontal lobe activity. The paper concludes with a discussion
	of the implications of construing the validity of these neuropsychological
	tests in anatomical, rather than cognitive and behavioral, terms.},

	the developmental profile of executive processes across childhood.
	At the outset, {EF} is defined, and cognitive and behavioral impairments
	associated with executive dysfunction {(EDF)} are described. A developmental
	model of {EF} is proposed incorporating four discrete but inter-related
	executive domains (attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal
	setting, and information processing) which operate in an integrative
	manner to enable "executive control". Characteristics that constitute
	traditional {EF} measures are discussed, as are the problems associated
	with test interpretation. The ecological validity of {EF} tests and
	neuropsychological assessment procedures are examined, and adjunct
	methods of measurement are presented to enable a more comprehensive
	and valid assessment of {EF.} Based on developmental and normative
	studies, the maturation of executive domains is mapped. Attentional
	control appears to emerge in infancy and develop rapidly in early
	childhood. In contrast, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and
	information processing experience a critical period of development
	between 7 and 9 years of age, and are relatively mature by 12 years
	of age. A transitional period is thought to occur at the beginning
	of adolescence, and shortly after "executive control" is likely to
	emerge. In order to confirm our current understanding of {EF} development

	of spatiotemporally varying magnetic field inhomogeneities {(ΔB0)}
	caused by normal subject respiration and, in some studies, movement
	of the subject during the scan to perform tasks related to the functional
	paradigm. The presence of {ΔB0} during data acquisition distorts
	reconstructed images and introduces extraneous fluctuations in the

	Optimization of the {fMRI} data-processing pipeline to compensate
	for geometric distortions is of paramount importance to ensure high
	quality of {fMRI} data. To investigate {ΔB0} caused by subject movement,
	echo-planar imaging scans were collected with and without concurrent
	motion of a phantom arm. The phantom arm was constructed and moved
	by the experimenter to emulate forearm motions while subjects remained
	still and observed a visual stimulation paradigm. These data were
	then subjected to eight different combinations of preprocessing steps.
	The best preprocessing pipeline included navigator correction, a
	complex phase regressor and spatial smoothing. The synergy between
	navigator correction and phase regression reduced geometric distortions
	better than either step in isolation and preconditioned the data
	to make them more amenable to the benefits of spatial smoothing.
	The combination of these steps provided a 10\% increase in t-statistics

	designed to manipulate memory and inhibition independently and together,
	in steady state (single-task blocks) and during task-switching, and
	to be appropriate over the lifespan and for neuroimaging {(fMRI).}
	This is one of the first studies, in children or adults, to explore:
	(a) how memory requirements interact with spatial compatibility and
	(b) spatial incompatibility effects both with stimulus-specific rules
	{(Simon} task) and with higher-level, conceptual rules. Even the
	youngest children could hold information in mind, inhibit a dominant
	response, and combine those as long as the inhibition required was
	steady-state and the rules remained constant. Cognitive flexibility
	(switching between rules), even with memory demands minimized, showed
	a longer developmental progression, with 13-year-olds still not at
	adult levels. Effects elicited only in Mixed blocks with adults were
	found in young children even in single-task blocks; while young children
	could exercise inhibition in steady state it exacted a cost not seen
	in adults, who (unlike young children) seemed to re-set their default
	response when inhibition of the same tendency was required throughout
	a block. The costs associated with manipulations of inhibition were
	greater in young children while the costs associated with increasing

	an accuracy cost on difficult trials. Contrary to our predictions
	of independence between memory and inhibition, when matched for difficulty

	correlations were less than half that. Spatial incompatibility effects

	in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual {(DSM)} represent homogeneous
	syndromes. However, the mechanistic heterogeneity that potentially
	underlies the existing classification scheme might limit discovery

	clarify neuropsychological heterogeneity in a large dataset of typically
	developing youth and youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder

	determine whether data-driven neuropsychological subtypes could be

	classification is the sine qua non for eventual clinical translation,
	we also apply support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis
	to identify how well {ADHD} status in individual children can be
	identified as defined by the community detection delineated subtypes.
	The analysis yielded several unique, but similar subtypes across
	both populations. Just as importantly, comparing typically developing
	children with {ADHD} children within each of these distinct subgroups
	increased diagnostic accuracy. Two important principles were identified
	that have the potential to advance our understanding of typical development
	and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. The first tenet suggests
	that typically developing children can be classified into distinct

	proposes that some of the heterogeneity in individuals with {ADHD}
	might be "nested" in this normal variation.},

  abstract  = {Structural equation modeling {(SEM)} is increasingly being chosen
	by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from
	the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging
	from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical
	modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability,
	and even purpose of {SEM.} Guidelines for implementing the expanded
	capabilities of {SEM} are currently lacking. In this paper we describe
	new developments in {SEM} that we believe constitute a third-generation
	of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the
	generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph.
	In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles
	rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels
	and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries
	and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a
	graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood
	methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the
	goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling
	process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification
	choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options,
	and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for
	prospective analyses. The illustrative example presented involves
	monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia
	National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process
	involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing
	inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to
	evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities
	and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation {(SE)}
	model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage
	of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions. The guidelines
	presented provide for an updated definition of the {SEM} process
	that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory
	implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex
	specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods.
	Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning
	in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative
	implications of the results.},

	to examine {VSWM} function in children, adolescents, and young adults,
	ages 7-22. Subjects performed a 2-back {VSWM} experiment that required
	dynamic storage and manipulation of spatial information. Accuracy
	and response latency on the {VSWM} task improved gradually, extending

	observed in focal regions of the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal
	cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (including Broca's area),
	left premotor cortex, and left and right posterior parietal cortex.
	Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relative contributions
	of age, accuracy, and response latency on activation. Our analysis
	showed that age was the most significant predictor of activation
	in these brain regions. These findings provide strong evidence for
	a process of protracted functional maturation of bilateral fronto-parietal

  abstract  = {Background Large amounts of electro-oculographic {(EOG)} data, recorded
	during electroencephalographic {(EEG)} measurements, go underutilized.
	We present an automatic, auto-calibrating algorithm that allows efficient
	analysis of such data sets. Methods The auto-calibration is based
	on automatic threshold value estimation. Amplitude threshold values
	for saccades and blinks are determined based on features in the recorded
	signal. The performance of the developed algorithm was tested by
	analyzing 4854 saccades and 213 blinks recorded in two different
	conditions: a task where the eye movements were controlled (saccade
	task) and a task with free viewing (multitask). The results were
	compared with results from a video-oculography {(VOG)} device and
	manually scored blinks. Results The algorithm achieved 93\% detection
	sensitivity for blinks with 4\% false positive rate. The detection
	sensitivity for horizontal saccades was between 98\% and 100\%, and
	for oblique saccades between 95\% and 100\%. The classification sensitivity
	for horizontal and large oblique saccades (10 deg) was larger than
	89\%, and for vertical saccades larger than 82\%. The duration and
	peak velocities of the detected horizontal saccades were similar
	to those in the literature. In the multitask measurement the detection
	sensitivity for saccades was 97\% with a 6\% false positive rate.
	Conclusion The developed algorithm enables reliable analysis of {EOG}
	data recorded both during {EEG} and as a separate metrics.},

	Here we demonstrate that measuring multisensory performance using

	targets detection experiment using stimuli of different intensity,
	both measures yield similar pattern of results supporting the "principle
	of inverse effectiveness". The second experiment, introducing stimulus
	onset asynchrony and differing instructions (focused attention vs.
	redundant targets task) further supports the usefulness of both indices.

	(10 cents) was delayed by between 0 and 30s, and the immediate reward
	varied in magnitude (0�?10 cents). In the {PD} task, receipt of the
	large reward (10 cents) varied in likelihood, with probabilities
	of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 used, and the certain reward varied

	choosing the immediate reward did not shorten overall task duration.
	This, together with the lack of interaction between {TD} task version

	by reward immediacy and not by delay aversion. Contrary to our predictions,

	that strong preferences for small immediate rewards in {ADHD,} as
	found in previous research, depend on factors such as total maximum
	gain and the use of fixed versus varied delay durations. The decrease
	in {TD} as observed in adolescents compared to children may be related
	to developmental changes in the (dorsolateral) prefrontal cortex.
	Future research needs to investigate these possibilities.},

	for impairments of each process after lesions in specific frontal
	regions. These processes and their coarse frontal localizations are
	energization—superior medial, task setting—left lateral and monitoring—right
	lateral. The strength of the findings lies in replication: across
	different tasks; across different cognitive modalities (e.g. reaction
	time paradigms, memory); and across different patient groups. This
	convergence minimizes the possibility that any of the findings are
	limited to a specific task or to a specific set of patients. Although
	distinct, these processes are flexibly assembled in response to context,
	complexity and intention over real time into different networks within
	the frontal regions and between frontal and posterior regions.},

	50 children with {ADHD} (31 {ADHD,} 19 {ADHD+RD)} and age-matched
	healthy controls (n~=~50) completed three psychophysical tasks: duration
	discrimination (target duration of 400 ms versus a foil duration),
	frequency discrimination (a control condition to evaluate general

	2 used the same tasks with an adolescent sample (35 {ADHD,} 24 {ADHD+RD,}
	39 controls). Results: In both studies, children and adolescents
	with {ADHD} and {ADHD+RD} displayed some impairments in duration
	discrimination and the precision with which they reproduced the intervals
	on the estimation task, particularly the shorter 400 ms interval.
	The most severe impairments tended to occur in the comorbid {ADHD+RD}
	group. No impairments were found on the frequency discrimination
	task. {ADHD} participants also displayed significant intra-individual
	variability in their performance on the estimation task. Finally,
	short-term and working memory, estimated full-scale {IQ,} and teacher
	report of hyperactivity/impulsivity were found to differentially
	predict performance on the time perception measures in the adolescent
	clinical sample. Conclusions: Deficits in duration discrimination,
	duration estimation, and intra-individual performance variability
	may have cascaded effects on the temporal organisation of behaviour

  abstract      = {Two competing theoretical models of individual differences in executive functioning (EF) were examined: the Prefrontal Convexity Model and the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Neurologically healthy individuals (N = 315; mean age 20.8) completed a modified switching task (MST) and the Attention Network Test (ANT) in a single testing session. Data analysis was conducted in two phases. In the first phase (model identification), latent profile analysis was applied to MST variables measuring the abilities to form, switch, and maintain mental sets under conditions designed to tax left or right hemisphere resources. In the second phase (model validation), participant clusters obtained from the first phase were compared on the ANT. The Model Identification phase yielded a 3-profile solution consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Model. Profile 1 (N = 203) was characterized by average EF performances. Profile 2 (N = 43) revealed a set maintenance weakness under non-verbal conditions. Profile 3 (N = 38) demonstrated weaknesses in cognitive flexibility combined with poor executive performances under verbal conditions. The Model Validation phase confirmed group differences. Profile 1 demonstrated average EF performances. Profile 2 demonstrated distractibility and decreased alertness, consistent with a right hemisphere weakness. Profile 3 demonstrated cognitive rigidity in the absence of external cues, consistent with a left hemisphere weakness. Individual differences in EF appear to follow a Hemispheric Asymmetry Model of EF among neurologically healthy adults. Investigating the relationship between hemispherically mediated executive functions and other individual difference factors known to confer health risk or resilience could inform numerous disciplines within the field of psychology.},

	research has questioned whether the underlying core-information processing
	is different for the 2 variants of a task or whether they differ
	mostly in response demands. The authors examined 4 different diffusion
	models for the go/no-go variant of each task along with a standard
	diffusion model for the 2-choice variant {(R.} Ratcliff, 1978). The
	2-choice and the go/no-go models were fit to data from 4 lexical
	decision experiments, 1 numerosity discrimination experiment, and
	1 recognition memory experiment, each with 2-choice and go/no-go
	variants. The models that assumed an implicit decision criterion
	for no-go responses produced better fits than models that did not.
	The best model was one in which only response criteria and the nondecisional
	components of processing changed between the 2 variants, supporting
	the view that the core information on which decisions are based is
	not different between them.},

  abstract  = {Background: Diagnostic and prognostic or predictive models serve different purposes. Whereas diagnostic models are usually used for classification, prognostic models incorporate the dimension of time, adding a stochastic element. Content: The ROC curve is typically used to evaluate clinical utility for both diagnostic and prognostic models. This curve assesses how well a test or model discriminates, or separates individuals into two classes, such as diseased and nondiseased. A strong risk predictor, such as lipids for cardiovascular disease, may have limited impact on the area under the curve, called the AUC or c-statistic, even if it alters predicted values. Calibration, measuring whether predicted probabilities agree with observed proportions, is another component of model accuracy important to assess. Reclassification can directly compare the clinical impact of two models by determining how many individuals would be reclassified into clinically relevant risk strata. For example, adding high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history to prediction models for cardiovascular disease using traditional risk factors moves approximately 30\% of those at intermediate risk levels, such as 5\%{\textendash}10\% or 10\%{\textendash}20\% 10-year risk, into higher or lower risk categories, despite little change in the c-statistic. A calibration statistic can asses how well the new predicted values agree with those observed in the cross-classified data. Summary: Although it is useful for classification, evaluation of prognostic models should not rely solely on the ROC curve, but should assess both discrimination and calibration. Risk reclassification can aid in comparing the clinical impact of two models on risk for the individual, as well as the population.},
